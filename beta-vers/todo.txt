TODO List : cdpl.c
	* Comments are not printed as a read-friendly output, TABs, SPACEs are not handled properly - This may be little hard to correct.
	* Above situation occurs mostly if source file was edited with a high-level text editor OR IDE (notepad++, Kate etc...)
	* Not all comments are separated.
Above issues remain to recover.
